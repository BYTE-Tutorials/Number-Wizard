# Number-Wizard

This is the code created during my video tutorial Number Wizard. 
The video is an introduction into programing and is created for anyone who 
has not yet an idea what programing is like.
We are going to create a small python program called Number Wizard. By doing so 
we are going to talk about some programing core topics. 

Topics mentioned in the video. 
 - Variables
 - Methods
 - Classes
 - Datatypes (Strings vs Integers)
 - Console input and output. 
 - If and Else conditions
